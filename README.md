# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX
### Introduction

In this capstone project I will deal with problems that data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. For this project I will be a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting the results to stakeholders. My main task will be to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.


### Business Problem

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars - other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if I can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, I can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of my Data Science findings and models, the competing startup that hired me can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

### Objective

To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch. Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.

### Business Metric

Classification accuracy - Defined as number of correct prediction divided by the total number of prediction.

### Deliverables

- Accurate predictive algorithms
- Business case report to stakeholders
